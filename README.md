# dotfiles

Various configurations for my various development tools, all in simple dotfile configs.

I add to these as and when I find helpful extras/tweaks to configs.

Feel free to share and use!

## Installation

1. Run from the `dotfiles` directory
2. Run: `./bootstrap.sh`

## git-config

After running the bootstrap script the `.gitconfig` file will be copied to your home directory. The `.gitconfig` file in this repo refers to a `.gitconfig_local` file for user credentials. For this reason it is **not recommended** to commit this file into version control.
